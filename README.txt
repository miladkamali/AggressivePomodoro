I created this project out of frustration with other Pomodoro projects like
productivity timer and gnome pomodoro. I had very simple needs

             1) enforce work break times by blocking work.
             2) keep track of pomodoro for different projects and tasks

Unfortunately neither of them had these features even though they are
far mature projects. So in span of two hours i put together this bash script for
my need.

Do what ever you want with this code!
